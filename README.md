## Example Usage

All I wrote for this effect is "MFDoorwayTransition" class. 
You can apply this effect easily in between two views like below : 

``` objective-c
MFDoorwayTransition *transition = [[MFDoorwayTransition alloc] 
                                        initWithBaseView:self.view 
                                               firstView:self.currentView 
                                                lastView:self.nextView];
[transition buildAnimation];
[transition release];
```
